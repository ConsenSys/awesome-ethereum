## Block Explorers

A block explorer is a tool that helps you browse the on-chain data in a user friendly way.  
Much more than just block listers, these explorers can give you a lot of insights on how a network works and what the activity on it really means, shining some light onto all those hex encoded strings.

## Network Monitors

Network monitors help you get an overview of the state of the chain. They usually include statistics about the participating nodes and what their current status is.
